# Extensibility Nomenclature

A brief history of our terminology

Over the years, Adobe Creative Cloud applications have supported ExtendScript **Scripts**, Flash **Panels**, CEP **Extensions**, UXP **Plugins** (either _regular_ or _hybrid_), and UXP **Scripts**. Uniquely, Adobe Express deals with **add-ons**, instead.

Most desktop applications have been supporting a different kind of _compiled_ plugins, often spelled **Plug-ins**; for example, as Effects in Premiere or Filters in Photoshop.

While this continues to be the case, Premiere will use **plugins**[^1] as a catch-all term for _panels_, _extensions_, and, eventually, _scripts_ as well. Primarily, this is to maintain consistency with the other Adobe Creative Cloud applications that have migrated—or are about to migrate—to the new UXP standard.

[^1]: More precisely, in the UXP ecosystem, a _plugin_ is a container of either _panel(s)_, _command(s)_, or both. This mirrors—and extends—how the CEP ecosystem has been using _extensions_ to contain _panel(s)_.
