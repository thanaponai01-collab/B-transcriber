# Premiere & the Unified Extensibility Platform

UXP powers a new era of Extensibility in Premiere

## Overview

UXP is a **JavaScript-based extensibility platform** (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps you automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of your favorite Adobe Creative Cloud products. It represents a comprehensive solution that lets you **use Web technologies to build new features and tools** for Desktop applications.

With UXP, you can for example:

1. **Automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks** in your daily workflow.
2. **Unlock creative effects** that are difficult—or even impossible—to achieve otherwise.
3. **Customize Premiere** to fit your unique work habits and preferred layouts.
4. **Build intuitive User Interfaces** that enhance the user experience.

Developing in UXP requires some basic knowledge of Web technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the following pages, we will cover the essentials you need to know to get started.

#### UXP is not a Browser

It's important to note that while UXP lets you use Web technologies, it is not conceived to be a standard browser environment or replacement; not all features that a browser natively supports will be available in UXP. However, the platform provides a wide range of capabilities tailored to building powerful and creative solutions for Desktop applications.

## Support and Features

UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including **Premiere** (version 25.6), **Photoshop**, and **InDesign**.

Plugins allow you to create a **persistent User Interface that blends seamlessly** with the host application (a `panel`), or an **actionable command** that runs a predefined function (a `command`) and can be triggered by the user via menu item—depending on how you would like the users to interact with them. For advanced use cases that require high-performance native code, UXP also supports [Hybrid Plugins](../plugins/hybrid-plugins/index.md)—standard UXP plugins extended with C++ libraries. You will learn all about them in the next sections.

Lastly, you can [easily share UXP plugins](../plugins/distribution/overview/index.md) with other users. You can distribute them in [Adobe Creative Cloud Marketplace](../plugins/distribution/adobe-marketplace/index.md) (giving you instant access to millions of Adobe users at once), via [third-party channels](../plugins/distribution/independent-distribution/index.md), or [within your own organization](../plugins/distribution/enterprise-distribution/index.md).
